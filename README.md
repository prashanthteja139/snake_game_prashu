## Overview

This Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself. The game is built using Python and the Pygame library, which provides the functionality for handling graphics, input, and game mechanics.

## Installation

To run this game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prashanthteja139/snake_game.git
   cd snake_game
   ```

2. **Install Pygame**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install Pygame using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Game**:
   After installing Pygame, you can run the Snake game with the following command:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

2. **Controls**:
   - **Arrow Keys**: Move the snake in the corresponding direction.
   - **Q**: Quit the game after losing.
   - **C**: Play again after losing.

## How It Works

- **Game Loop**: The main game loop handles events, updates the game state, and redraws the screen.
- **Snake Movement**: The snake moves based on keyboard input and grows when it eats food.
- **Collision Detection**: The game checks for collisions with the wall and with itself to determine if the game is over.
- **Food Generation**: Food appears at random locations, and when eaten, the snake grows and new food is generated.
